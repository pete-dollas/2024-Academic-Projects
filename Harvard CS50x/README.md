Link to Scratch project link, where I created a balloon counting Math Activity for Kindergarten-age learners.   

This is aligned to Common Core Standard KOA2: Operations and Algebraic Thinking: 

"Understand addition as putting together and adding to...add within 10 by using objects or drawings to represent the problem."
